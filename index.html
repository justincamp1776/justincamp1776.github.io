                    <br>
            <p5>Over the last decade, I worked endlessly to hone my skills as a 
                strength and conditioning coach. I spent countless hours helping young athletes become their best and perform at their best. Time and again I saw how 
                the process of development could be modeled, recorded, and tracked. Whether  movement patterns and mechanics or thinking patterns and perspective, the linear 
                progression of development had always been a beauiful phenomonon to witness.</p5>
