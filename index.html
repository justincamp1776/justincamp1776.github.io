            <p5 class = "about-me">Over the last decade, I've worked endlessly to hone my skills as a 
            strength and conditioning coach. I spent countless hours helping young athletes become their best and perform at their best. Time and again I saw how 
            the process of development could be modeled, recorded, and tracked.  Whether it was movement patterns and mechanics or thinking patterns and perspective, the 
            progression of development was always a beautiful phenomonon to witness.It is that same phenomonon that drew me to software developement. With the evolution of AI,
                we can model real life scenarios and expect real life results. There is an undiscovered world just beyond the finger tips of today's software developer. 
                It's a world where anything is possible! </p5> <br><br><br>

                <p7 class = "about-me">In 2020, the world came to a screeching halt. We all were left to consider what life would look like going forward. It was in that place that <strong>I made the life changing decision to 
                    chase my dreams</strong>. </p7><br><br>
                <p7> As a newby in the industry, I have much to learn. I can't honestly make claims about my accolades or refer you to the development team that I was formerly apart of. However, I can tell you that
                    I am extremely passionate about my chosen path and that I work around the clock to be the best developer that I can be. I am a team player and work well with others. I am meticulous in planning and very critical
                    of my work. I expect the best from myself regardless of the circumstance. I am a U.S. Army Veteran who has character, integrity, and strong work ethic. I believe that my creative ability and life experiences
                    will add value to any team. </p7>
